    Example 1:

    Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
    Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
    Explanation:
    rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
    rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
    rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
</pre>

<pre>
    Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
</pre>

<p>
    Constraints:

    1 &lt;= nums.length &lt;= 2 * 104
    -231 &lt;= nums[i] &lt;= 231 - 1
    0 &lt;= k &lt;= 105

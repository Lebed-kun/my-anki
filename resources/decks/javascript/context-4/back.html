<p>
    When a function is called with the new keyword, couple of things happen behind the scenes:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        A new empty object is created
    </li>

    <li>
        The context object <i>this</i> is bound to the new empty object
    </li>

    <li>
        The new object is linked to the functionâ€™s prototype property
    </li>

    <li>
        <i>this</i> is automatically returned unless another value is returned explicitly from the function
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    This is the mechanism provided by JavaScript to link objects with prototype objects.

    In the snippet above, there is a reference being made to a function 
    and itâ€™s being called without a context. 
    In non-strict mode, <i>this</i> would be bound to the global object. 
    But here we are in strict mode, therefore <i>this</i> will be set to undefined. 
    And trying to read the <i>id</i> property from undefined, will throw a type error:

<pre>
    TypeError: Cannot read property 'id' of undefined

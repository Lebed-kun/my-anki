<ul>
    <li>
        In the snippet above, lines A will evaluate to the types of a and B. 
        Both are functions so the typeof operator will return function for both.
    </li>

    <li>
        In lines B we are evaluating the prototypes of function. 
        Both are functions and they are linked to Function.prototype. 
        So the value of Function.prototype will be returned for each.
    </li>

    <li>
        Now, lines C are interesting because we are evaluating the prototype property of a and B. 
        Now, because a is an arrow function it doesn't have a prototype property so 
        undefined will be returned. But since function B is a non-arrow function, an object will 
        be returned that includes properties like constructor, __proto__.

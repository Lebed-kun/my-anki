    Given two 1d vectors, implement an iterator to return their elements alternately.
</pre>

<pre>
    Example 1:

    Input:
    [
        [1,2]
        [3,4,5,6] 
    ]


    Output: [1,3,2,4,5,6]


    Explanation: By calling  next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, 
    the order of elements returned by next
    should be: [1,3,2,4,5,6].

    Follow up: What if you are givenk1d vectors? How well can your code be extended to such cases?

    Clarification for the follow up question:
    The "Zigzag" order is not clearly defined and is ambiguous for k > 2 cases. 
    If "Zigzag" does not look right to you, replace "Zigzag" with "Cyclic". For example:
</pre>

<pre>
    Input:

    [
        [1,2,3]
        [4,5,6,7]
        [8,9]
    ]

    Output: [1,4,8,2,5,9,3,6,7].
</pre>

<pre>
    Another example:

    [1,2,3,5],
    [4,11],
    [8,9,7,16,6],
    [],
    [10,20,12]
    -->
    [1, 4, 8, 10, 2, 11, 9, 20, 3, 7, 12, 5, 16, 6]
</pre>
